#Proposal
Although Kylin provides sub-second OLAP [analysis latency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_business_intelligence), [data latency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_business_intelligence) is still very long. Because it uses ETL batch generated Hive tables as the source to build cubes. The ETL process usually takes hours to finish and the cube building process itself also needs few hours. User cannot use Kylin to analyze up-to-a-mintue data.

Currently, Kylin's cube builder uses cube metadata (defined by cube admin or designer) to build a cube from one fact table and several dimension tables in Hive. A cube is stored as one or multiple HTables in HBase, each HTable is called a segment of the cube. The metadata is stored in HBase. The dimension tables are also imported into HBase, stored as snapshots. Kylin's query engine will parse SQL query from the client and fetch the required data from HBase.

To reduce the data latency ultimately, we can build the cube from stream data instead of static data(generated by ETL batch). The feasibility of performing OLAP analysis on high volume of stream data has been studied a decade ago ([Online Analytical Processing Stream Data: Is It Feasible?](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~ychen/public/J82.pdf)). They proposed a feasible method called stream_cube, which uses a _tilt time frame_, explores only cuboids from _minimal interesting layer_ and _observation layer_, and adopts an algorithm called _popular path_ to partially materialize the cube. The study showed the approach is cost-effective and realistic.

We can ingest up-to-date data from realtime messaging system (e.g. [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)) and implement stream_cube as a Topology of [Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org/) to build Kylin cube segments continuously. This can be a solution to solve the data latency problem for Kylin. Below is a high level architecture diagram of this solution.
